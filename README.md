**Problem Statement (150 words):**
The Esports industry has been experiencing exponential growth, with a surge in popularity among gamers and spectators alike. However, with the rapid proliferation of Esports tournaments, participants and enthusiasts face challenges in discovering and accessing relevant information about upcoming events. Existing tournament platforms lack user-friendly interfaces, making it difficult to find comprehensive details on tournaments, including schedules, registration processes, and prize pools. Moreover, there is a lack of centralized platforms that cater to diverse Esports titles, leading to fragmented user experiences. This fragmentation hampers the potential for sponsors and advertisers to reach their target audiences effectively. Thus, there is a pressing need for a streamlined Esports Tournament Landing Page that consolidates information for various gaming titles, enhances accessibility, and fosters engagement for both participants and viewers.

Additionally, sponsors and advertisers can leverage the platform's broad audience reach to effectively target their marketing efforts, promoting sustainable growth for the Esports industry. This landing page can act as a hub for Esports enthusiasts, promoting camaraderie and competition while fostering the spirit of Esports on a global scale.
